# Firefox-Password-Grabber-Payload
This payload uses the simplest version because i made it to be able to run in an pico ducky.

to put the payload in the pico ducky just download the payload.dd and then put it inside the pico ducky (or any other usb because it a very simple code).
If you know how to make this code better you can always let me know but i think its pretty good the only downside is it being kinda slow..
